Homework 4 assignment

Observations:
1. Students were much more likely to pass both reading (at over 83%) and math (at over 83%) if they attended a charter school, than students who went to district schools, who passed reading (at just over 80%) and math (at just over 76%).

2. Students across school types were most likely to pass reading and overall in their classes if they had an ideal school size of 1000-2000 students (where those passing reading was at 96.79%). Those who went to small or large schools had lower scores than those who went to medium schools.

Resources:
All prompts for this assignment were based in existing classwork so most had examples from class that I could pull work from.

When there was not an immediate match from class work examples, outside resources were noted directly in the code file specific to their sections.
